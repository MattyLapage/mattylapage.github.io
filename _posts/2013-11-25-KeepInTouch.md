My friend John has been working on his first Android product, an application that will remind you when you've gone too long without contacting one of those fringe connections - the people you want to stay in touch with but don't run into organically very often. He asked me to come up with some designs for him so he could stay focused on the code and, in his words, "ignore all that other shit", and I'm happy to help there.

The flow should be as follows:

Basically, you set an alarm (i.e. "Talk to John every 3 weeks"), and the app will monitor your communications with that person. If 3 weeks go by with out your sending a text, email or call, the app reminds you that you're <span class='green'>friends</span> with John, and maybe you should talk to him more, yeah?

It's pretty straightforward, though there are some pitfalls in it's an app that:

- Sets alarms, so people need to know what to expect from those
- Pushes notifications, so those need to not annoy the people like they usually do
- Monitors who you call and text (for automatic reset purposes), so people need to not be terrified by that

All of this needs to be worked into the design somewhere, while keeping to mobile norms of being easy to use, touch based, etc.
