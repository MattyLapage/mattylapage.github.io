    This is Alphonse, he's an owl shaped watering can that I fill with spare change and uses as a doorman (/-stop). He and I have been through a lot together. When last emptied, he cashed in at $98.53, mostly in dimes. I bought him while burning time in my local Target, waiting to see the Transformers in 2007. I have no idea why I made the purchase.

For a while I was mulling over the implications of online shopping and impulse purchases. The layout of modern online shopping titans is largely search oriented - you type in a keyword and see a number of items that fit your description. Sure, you might end up buying something totally unexpected, but that's not the same as having something catch your eye on the walk over. It's not the same as seeing this:
</p>

<div class="image center">
    <img src="/images/post-images/2013-11-14-Awning-The-Eyes.jpg"/>
</div>
<p>
and thinking, "Yeah. That's worth $11. Yes."
</p>

<p>
    This got me thinking about the idea of creating a browsing-centric shopping portal, one in which not only store fronts but the aisles and gaudy displays of traditional shopping centers would somehow invade our otherwise orderly online experience.
</p>
<p>
    As an excercise, this is a weird one. In physical shopping spaces, we'll be walking over to aisle 3, or to the 'shampoo' corner of the store when things have a chance catch our eye. By occupying shelf space somewhere between where I am and where I was going, Alphonse didn't actively distrupt my goals in anyway; he distracted me sure, but it was my choice to let that distraction actually interfere with my objective.
</p>
<p>
    This doesn't work online. There is no concept of travel time, there's no excess visual space these items can occupy, and if it's easy to get distracted from your target purchase, it's probably pretty easy to get distracted from the site as a whole (as is the nature of easily-closed browser tabs).
</p>
<p>
    So what can we do? My first couple sketches were pretty straightforward - just make giant images. Like, really giant. Window shopping isn't based on descriptions, it's based on things that stand out enough to warrant a second glance. This sort of product does exist, a good example is <a href="www.fab.com">fab.com</a>, where the site design supports a visual-centric experience. It's... like window shopping for sure, but there's no sense of real departure as you're still looking within a category. Outside of the home page, there's no place you'll see bright blue owl-wateringcans next to snack foods.
</p>
<p>
    As of my writting this, I don't really have a good idea on how to make that happen. Incorporating discovery oriented shopping without ANY restrictions just doesn't seem possible with any shopping site I've seen. But we can try to make something new that will create this effect. 10 minutes in Omnigraffle and this is my idea:
</p>

<div class="image center">
    <img src="/images/post-images/2013-11-14-Awning-uimock.jpg"/>
    <div class="caption ext center">
        "Awning" is a kinda clever name, right?
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Basically, user interaction is restricted to four elements:
    <ul>
        <li> An refresh button, that just wipes all shown items. </li>
        <li> The items themselves, linking away from this page an to whatever shopping site sells the product. </li>
        <li> A color slider, intended to be one of the few digitally viable filters that closely reflects the action of physical visual scanning - if you know that Yellow pops out for you, then filter by it. </li>
        <li> A price slider, because I can't imagine ever using this system without one... nobody window shops for $100+ items, so we might as well narrow the results here. </li>
    </ul>
    User interaction on this page is very simply: set a few filters, click show, see if anything stands out, refresh, repeat. That's it. It's going to have a lot of bad items (maybe just pull in the amazon API or something), it's going to not be very fun, but it's a first step to a pretty weird problem.
