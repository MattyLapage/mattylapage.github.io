<h4 class="green">Goal:</h4>
Make an online shopping portal that rewards untargeted browse-centric shopping, similar to window shopping in physical marketplaces.

<h4 class="purple">Results:</h4>
Eh. Fun to think about, not necessarily viable.

<h4 class="orange">The Future:</h4>
Let's just let this one sit.

While working at Next Jump, I took part in building the product listing page for an onsite integration to the 1-800-Flowers catalogue. Though this wasn't the first such shopping portal our site had, it was unique in that the products themselves were far more visually oriented than, say, gift cards. This meant that our listing page had to provide as much visual information as possible - we had to show what the bouquets looked like, spending less time on informative text (i.e. "bouquet includes violets of blue yadda yadda").

We went with a basic grid layout, which certainly does the trick, but the whole exercise got me thinking about one of the major ways in which online shopping differs from physical stores.

This is Alphonse, he's an owl shaped watering can that I fill with spare change and uses as a doorman (/-stop). He and I have been through a lot together. When last emptied, he cashed in at $98.53, mostly in dimes. I bought him while burning time in my local Target, waiting to see the Transformers in 2007. I have no idea why I made the purchase.

Online shopping doesn't really allow for this sort of impulse buy. Impulse buys as a whole are certainly possible, and very frequent, but what was weird here was what I purchased, not that I purchased it.
The layout of online shopping titans is search oriented; you type in a keyword and see a number of items that fit your description. Sure, you might end up buying something totally unexpected, but that's not the same as having something catch your eye on the walk over. It's not the same as seeing this:

<div class="image center">
    <img src="/images/post-images/2013-11-14-Awning-The-Eyes.jpg"/>
</div>

and thinking, "Yeah. That's worth $11."

This got me thinking about the idea of creating a browsing-centric shopping portal, one in which the often gaudy displays of traditional shopping centers would somehow invade our otherwise orderly online experience. Because Alphonse was never going to show up in any search I made, and he'd never be a featured front-page product, and he'd never show up in a "recommended for you" tab but damnit I love the little guy.

In physical shopping spaces, we'll be walking over to aisle 3 or to the 'shampoo' corner of the store when things have a stand out and snag our attention. Having something occupy shelf space somewhere between where I was and where I was going didn't distrupt my goals in anyway; I was distracted sure, but it was my choice to let that distraction actually interfere with my objective.

This doesn't happen online. Travel time isn't a thing, so there's no down time when a user knows they have to wait for something and are open to, at least passively, see something new. There's no excess visual space these items can occupy, just the tiny window filled with bits and pieces guiding users of that ideal flow that ends with a purchase. After all, if it's easy to get distracted from your target purchase it's easy to get distracted from the site as a whole (as is the nature of easily-closed browser tabs).

Window shopping is viable when things stand out enough to warrant a second glance. The readily available metrics of online shopping, things like user reviews, buy frequencies, item tags, etc, don't really hold up as a means to capture attention. Any system that wants to make this happen will have to rely on visuals. A good example of how a digital world could support this is <a href="www.fab.com">fab.com</a>, where the site design creates a visual-centric experience in which product design and visual aestetics are prioritized over objective descriptors. But there's still a bit missing.

There's no sense of real departure as you're still looking within a category. Outside of the home page, there's no place you'll see bright blue owl-wateringcans next to snack foods, and honestly putting something like that readily visible is a pretty bad idea as so few people will be spurred to action. It's being there was pretty much strictly by chance.

So we're looking at discovery oriented shopping without any category based restrictions and with heavy randomization. 10 minutes in Omnigraffle and this is my idea:

<div class="image center">
    <img src="/images/post-images/2013-11-14-Awning-uimock.jpg"/>
    <div class="caption ext center">
        "Awning" is a kinda clever name, right?
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Basically, user interaction is restricted to four elements:
    <ul>
        <li> An refresh button, that just wipes all shown items and replaces them with random new ones. </li>
        <li> The items themselves, linking away from this page an to whatever shopping site sells the product. </li>
        <li> A color slider, intended to be one of the few digitally viable filters that closely reflects the action of physical visual scanning - if you know that Yellow pops out for you, then filter by it. </li>
        <li> A price slider, because I can't imagine ever using this system without one... nobody window shops for $100+ items, so we might as well narrow the results here. </li>
    </ul>
    User interaction on this page is very simply: set a few filters, click show, see if anything stands out, refresh, repeat. That's it.
</p>

It's going to have a lot of bad items, it's going to not be very fun, but it's a first step.
