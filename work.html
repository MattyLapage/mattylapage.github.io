                        A design system chart of different button states, including information on the color contrast values for those states. There was a lot of design debate about whether to avoid disabled buttons entirely as they're bad for communicating status, but ultimately we decided to have a visual handy even if we hoped to rarely use it.

                        An series of user workflow diagrams for our admissions team. Our application forms have to communicate with wildly unique university data systems, and before this project launched in 2018 the data export jobs were done by hand. As part of designing these pages, I spent weeks shadowing the teams responsible for those automated tasks to fully understand what was needed, and how our tools could best support these internal teams.

                        A journey map of the steps users take as they consider applying to one of our graduate programs. This chart was made after a month of interviewing team leaders to build a clear understanding of what tech stacks users were interacting with when. 2U's early growth meant a number of systems with overlapping audiences were built in parallel, and our team was working to align product goals with a unified user story

                        Web mockup for the Indie Maker Syndicate (IMS) home page. IMS was an informal name we used in 2020 for our online games expo, which featured 50 games from indie devs. We really wanted to do something for this scene, as a lot of game devs rely on festivals for exposure. All of the junk on the sides is stuff I found in my house, put on a living room floor and photographed.

                        A screenshot of our livestream for an alternative control game jam. Participants were invited to build a small controller using a rotary dial and 2 buttons, and then build games for that custom controller. Though this is a simple example, this sort of non-standard input is exactly the sorta thing that gets me excited about the alt control games scene.

                        Stream overlay from our 2021 Extra Life fundraiser. These visuals were used to get precise element positioning in our streaming software, though most of the assets here are non-static: the donation ticker is a website I built hooked into the charity API, the bottom banner scrolls every 50 seconds, etc.

Over 5 years of hosting an event that relies on 2 capture cards, 4 webcams and 5 PCs I've learned to uh... never assume all of the things will always work. So we built out tons of variants for every permutation to make sure the live content is as good as possible.
