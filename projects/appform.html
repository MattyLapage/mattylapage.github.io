                <p>
                    Over four years of research and iterative design we reimagined both the application process aspiring students went through to enroll in online degrees and the content tools used by universities to manage student data. We built a forms design system focused on accessibility and a CMS emphasizing efficiency for internal teams and stakeholders.

                <p>
                    Reimagine our university application workflow, addressing accessibility debt and building improved experiences for end users and internal stakeholders at the same time

            <h2>Detailed Process</h2>
            <p>
                As an embedded designer on our online applications development team, I worked closely with lead developers to pitch a full redesign of our existing applications system to to leadership, replacing both the final form interfaces shown to users as they apply to our online programs and the suite of internal tools used by universities to track applicants and manage form content.
            </p>
            <p>
                This meant approaching the problem from both ends: thinking about how we could best set up a forms architecture that would meet the content flexibility needs of our university partners while keeping clear and concise form design for users.

            <p>
                The two projects operated under very different needs - university admins wanted a CMS that was infinitely flexible, available yesterday, and didnâ€™t care if it was ugly; while our external users needed a streamlined forms UI that would maximize clarity (and accessibility) while guiding them through the application process. The first year was spent almost entirely on research, mapping out internal processes and building bridges with other teams in marketing and university relations, while testing prototypes of a forms system with potential users.
            </p>
            <p>
                I shaped my design process to match the divide in user needs: leaning on rough wireframes for the CMS, while polishing visuals for a forms design system and minimalist UI for students.

                As our new systems went live in 2018, UAT showed unanimously positive reactions to our new design. Users cited the application overview pages working as intended to help them plan ahead for longer tasks (essays, referrals, etc) and found the validation and error recovery flows easy to work with. Internal tools had a quick iterative cycle (as I could run focus groups and user tests with other 2U employees), and as our first internal tools were released in 2018 the time save reported by our stakeholder was massive. This was all kinda expected, as we were replacing a dev-heavy flow with a dedicated tooling, but was still nice to see just how much of a difference it made.
