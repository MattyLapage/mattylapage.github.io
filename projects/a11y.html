                <p>
                    I work with our design and product teams to build inclusive processes and move accessibility left in our development lifecycle. I've been contributing visuals and documentation to our <a href="https://paragon-openedx.netlify.app/" target="_blank">design systems</a>, running design critiques and pairing sessions with UX designers, building and running workshops to build accessibility knowledge, and working with product leadership to scope accessibility features.

                    Advocate accessibility across org structure, build design processes and artifacts that embody inclusve principals, reduce A11Y debt in the long term

            <h2>Detailed Process</h2>
            <p>
                Early on in my design career I took ownership of a highly sensitive accessibility-themed redesign, tasked with both “make this accessible” and “figure out what it means for a design to be accessible.” The more I learned about inclusive design from mentors and peers, the clearer it became to me that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Accessibility was treated largely as a source of technical debt, with inaccessible designs making it all the way to production before major usability flaws were surfaced
                </li>
                <li>
                    Work done to address that debt was often messy and expensive
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inclusive design practices not only reduced this future debt, but simply led to good design, highlighting edge cases and building future proof processes and products
                </li>
                <li>
                    For all of the above, an engineer-turned-designer with an interest in alternative control schemes and hardware made me a… kinda perfect fit the work?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                So after 5 years working as a designer in 2U's UX team, I shifted in 2020 to a new role as a designer embedded in our accessibility team. 2U is held to a high standard by our partners (WCAG AA 2.1), and by working as a conduit between our accessibility org, software development leadership, and design teams I’ve been able to move accessibility earlier in our design process and advocate across organizations for broader, a11y-first approach to access in our learning tools.

                This role has included a lotta different tasks, including regularly working with senior leadership to make sure my role makes sense in the org. I’ve built out learning plans and workshops for our design teams, managed audits of our live products (or just tested things myself in VoiceOver/TalkBack), paired with developers to fix arcane screenreader bugs, and worked to pitch different ways accessibility can fit into our SDLC; all while making sure to remain an active member of our product design teams. More recently I’ve been working on major overhauls of our <a href="https://paragon-openedx.netlify.app/" target="_blank">design system Paragon's</a> ecosystem, addressing how to build out not only the visual and code libraries but the documentation and tooling necessary to make sure our components are accessible in practice across all our products and domains.
