                            Designed curriculum, presentations and workshops to promote inclusive thinking across product teams. Built and ran training for development and UX teams to build a shared understanding of how our designs and code can best meet the diverse needs of our users, shifting the accessibility conversation away from post-production compliance audits and towards holistic planning.
