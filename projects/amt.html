                                        Accessibility first redesign of our online application system from ground up,
                                        including end user views, a multi-stage form builder for internal users, and
                                        data migration interface for university partners. This project included
                                        extensive internal flow analysis, user testing, accessibility testing, and code
                                        prototyping.

                        <p>
                            The Application System team at 2U is responsible for running secure online application forms
                            for all our university partners, many of which request specific copy and unique questions on
                            a per-degree basis. At the time of my joining, our platform required developer action to
                            make any copy or question changes, as well as a steep time investment to stand up new
                            partners. The user facing aspect was buggy and near unusable on mobile, with long form pages
                            and poor affordances around validation and data saving. I worked with product and
                            engineering leadership to outline a blue sky rearchitecture of our entire ecosystem,
                            including a suite of online tools for these standup and maintenance tasks as well as an
                            improved user experience for our applicants with consistently structured WCAG 2.1 compliant
                            form interactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This process started with nearly a year of exploration work, where I led and moderated
                            journey mapping exercises to build a shared understanding of internal processes and debt
                            that had evolved over 2U’s rapid early tech growth.I ran interviews and tested prototypes
                            with our targeted internal users to understand their needs and priorities, and presented to
                            senior leadership on ways in which we could majorly shift our form content structure to make
                            filling out of forms easier for applicants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As much of the end user experience would be dictated by form copy and hierarchy design, I
                            worked closely with the teams responsible for this work to build content and usage
                            guidelines for different question types and formats (i.e. when to use radio inputs vs select
                            dropdowns). For more complex inputs, I conducted accessibility testing with low vision users
                            to ensure we were making inputs that were usable via assistive technology. These design
                            patterns became the basis for a team-specific component library of question types and core
                            interactions, which I would later transform into patterns for a company wide design system.

                            Our internal tooling ended up being the most complicated portion of the project; it was also
                            an interesting experience from a design standpoint as it was a pure function over form
                            project, and we often cut scope on visual features as in testing the internal teams that
                            would be using it simply didn’t care about styling. This led us to a number of dense,
                            efficiency minded pages and flows that the team loved, though we were careful to make sure
                            they scaled their team training accordingly.

                            The full suite began rollout in 2018 with a small scale MVP (used for letters of
                            recommendation), and has since been deployed for all partners following a few
                            future-proofing iteration cycles.
