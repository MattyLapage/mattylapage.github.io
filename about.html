<h3> Biography </h3>
<p>
    I am a Brooklyn based psychology nerd with an acute interest in Human Computer Interaction and they way user data can inform design practices. In 2011 I received my Bachelors in Psychology from Cornell University, returned to Cornell for a 2012 Masters of Professional Studies in Information Science. I have spent the year since working as a full stack web developer at Next Jump Inc, a NYC based e-commerce platform, and am now seeking out new opportunities in the realms of User Experience and Product design.

<h3> Work History </h3> 
    <h4> Next Jump: </h4>
        <p>
            From August 2012 through October 2013 I worked at Next Jump as a Web Applications Developer. As a full stack developer in a six person pod, I developed consumer facing sites in PHP, CSS and Javascript with occasional back-end scripting in SQL. For the most part this involved updates to our onsite shopping portal at <a href="oo.com" target="_blank">OO.com</a>. I coordinated cross team with our Customer Service and Design teams, as well as communicating directly with customers, to locate and repair UX pain points and rebuild our onsite Help center by better understanding user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked with a three person team on the ongoing rebranding of the Next Jump Corporate blog using Github Pages and Jekyll, including design of the blog itself, copy editing of posts, and PR.
        </p>
        <p>
            Took on a leading role in organizing weekly in-office social events and occasional off-site events, and became the first official Next Jump NY kegmaster responsible for keeping the lounge kegerators stocked and running 24/7.
