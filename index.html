                    <p>
                        I am an accessibility focused product designer, excited by the ways that inclusive thinking can shape design processes and build better experiences for all. For the last decade I've been working in the NYC tech scene, starting with a year of engineering work before moving into design and accessibility. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe accessibility belongs in the front of the design process, and that our solutions are at their best when we challenge ourselves to empathize with all users. I am currently looking for opportunities on design teams where I can help make incredible products come to life.

                    <p>
                        I am currently working at <a href="https://2u.com/">2U Inc</a>, a digital education company partnering with universities to bring degrees fully online. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work focuses on the centering of accessibility and inclusive practices in the design process, via training sessions, design system governance and documentation, and working with leadership to better define the goals of our products and ensure all learners can get the most out of our systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to my current role in accessibility, I worked as a Senior Product Designer, with a focus on building internal content management systems as part of a small UX team. My largest project was a full rebuild of our student application funnel spanning, including both new internal tools for our partner management teams and a design system revamp for the user facing forms.

                    <p>
                        Outside of professional work, I run the curation team for the <a href="https://super.magfest.org/indie-arcade"> MAGFest Indie Arcade</a>, an annual games festival celebrating weird control interfaces and interactive art. In addition to the actual curation and submission processes, this role also includes building out assets for livestreams and PR, particularly in 2020 when we put together an online-only event.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through friends I've made at MAG, I've also run smaller indie game dev livestreams at <a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/">Wonderville</a> in NYC, for which I produced all stream assets.

                    <p>
                        I've also led a pile of friends for annual <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/"> Extra Life </a> charity stream marathons, raising $15k over the past few years. As with the MAG stuff a lot of the work done here isn't <em>really</em> design related but just like above I end up spending a ton of time building visual languages for our stream content.

                    From 2014-2015 I led design and front-end development (in that I was the only designer/FE dev) as part of a three person development team for a B2B licensing startup with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iq-license"> iQ License</a>. As the company was just getting started, this involved a lot of UX research work, meeting with clients to learn about their ideal workflows and problems with the current application. Design work here was a lot of forms, which is a bit of a theme for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 2012-2013 I started my first tech job as a Web App Developer at <a href="https://nextjump.com/">Next Jump</a>. My largest projects there were on our checkout system (forms!) and building a new customer help center.
