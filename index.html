There was a lot of internal design debate about whether to simply avoid disabled buttons entirely as they're poor affordances to users, but ultimately we decided to have a visual handy even if we hoped to rarely use it (if ever).">

                        Prior to my correct role in accessibility, I worked as a Senior Product Designer, with a focus on building internal content management systems as part of a small UX team. My largest project was a full rebuild of our student application funnel spanning, including both new internal tools for our partner management teams and a design system revamp for the user facing forms.

As the company was just getting started, this involved a lot of UX research work, meeting with clients to learn about their ideal workflows and problems with the current application. Design work here was a lot of forms, which is a bit of a theme for me.
